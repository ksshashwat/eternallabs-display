# PRD: Portfolio Display Website (Client-Side App)

## tl;dr

A sleek, minimalistic, modular portfolio site showcasing your personal profile, products, current YouTube learning activity with notes, and links to external platforms. All content is driven by a separate admin panel.

## Problem Statement

Independent creators and builders need a clean, modular way to present their digital work, current learning, and thought leadership across the internet ‚Äî all in one elegant, live-updating portfolio interface. Most portfolios are either static or overly complicated to maintain. This portfolio solves that by decoupling content entry (via an admin app) from content presentation.

## Narrative

Imagine you‚Äôre a potential collaborator, investor, or even just a curious internet wanderer. You land on a page that instantly tells you who the person is ‚Äî not through a wall of text, but through what they‚Äôre building, learning, and thinking about. You can see their active projects, peek at what‚Äôs inspiring them, and dive deeper only if you want to. This isn‚Äôt a resume. It‚Äôs a living, modular, quietly powerful space ‚Äî always current, powered by a lightweight admin backend.
